1. -UNITRANS umoiq has a cap on how many no. of queries you can send to the API using a specific key. You cannot prompt it too often.
2. -curl "https://webservices.umoiq.com/api/pub/v1/locations/38.557898,-121.720308/predictions" only works if the given coordinates match that of a bus stop in the catalog, not any random coordinates.
